#Signal Generator
The Signal Generator and Visualizer is a Python-based application that allows users to generate and visualize basic waveforms, including sine, square, and triangular waves. This project provides an intuitive interface where users can modify key signal parameters such as frequency, amplitude, and phase, and observe the changes in real time using Matplotlib for plotting.

#Key Features:
Waveform Generation: The program can generate three types of waveforms:
Sine Wave
Square Wave
Triangular Wave

#Customizable Parameters: Users can control the following signal characteristics:

Frequency: Controls the number of oscillations per unit of time.
Amplitude: Adjusts the height (intensity) of the wave.
Phase: Shifts the wave along the time axis.
Real-time Visualization: Matplotlib is used to dynamically plot the generated waveform based on the user-defined parameters. Users can visualize how changes in frequency, amplitude, and phase impact the shape of the wave.

#Technologies Used:
Python: For the core logic and waveform generation.
NumPy: For efficient mathematical operations, including waveform calculations.
Matplotlib: For plotting and visualizing the generated waveforms.
